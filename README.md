Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is JerÃ³nimo Luza, and I am a Spatial Data Scientist focusing on technology and quantitative analysis in policy research. 

I'm currently working for the Strategic Planning Division (SPD) at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), where I leverage cloud computing technologies and data science methods to facilitate impact evaluations on social and environmental infrastructure projects.

My data toolkit is composed by:

- Python
- R
- Unix/Linux
- Bash
- AWS

While not working, I like contributing to open source software, playing sports, and doing fun stuff outside.

Some of my contributions:
- [EL-BID/UrbanPy](https://github.com/EL-BID/urbanpy)
- [EL-BID/SentinelDownloader](https://github.com/EL-BID/SentinelDownloader)
- [perrygeo/rasterstats](https://github.com/perrygeo/python-rasterstats)
