I am a GIS software developer and spatial data scientist focusing on quantitative analysis in policy research, leveraging cloud computing technologies and data science methods to facilitate impact evaluations on social and environmental infrastructure projects. While not working, I like to contribute to open source software, play sports, and doing fun stuff outside.
